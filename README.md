## Description

This project is a logo maker application that utilizes object-oriented programming principles to generate SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) logos. The application prompts the user for input regarding text, shapes, colors, and other design elements to create customized SVG logos. By leveraging object-oriented design, the application provides a flexible and scalable solution for logo creation.

## User Story
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   - git clone https://github.com/your-username/svg-logo-maker.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
   - cd svg-logo-maker


3. Install the necessary dependencies:
